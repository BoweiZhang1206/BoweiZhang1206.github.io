    <h2>Why I Choose combined major</h2>
    <p>
      My major interest lies in the intersection between data science and Business. 
      I believe that financial technology is changing the world, especially through algorithmic trading and data-driven decision-making. 
      To be more realistic, these areas can help me to earn more money.
      Now, world is growing with AI technology, if I can catch this chance, I will be successful in the future
    </p>

    <h2>Projects I did</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve built my own stock backtesting system using Python and Backtrader to simulate trading strategies and evaluate performance. 
      This project helped me understand technical indicators, portfolio management, and how to manage risk.
      I also analyzed social media sentiment data to explore how online opinions may influence short-term stock movements.
      These hands-on experiences taught me that real learning happens when theory meets practice.
    </p>

    <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
    <p>
      In the future, I hope to combine my programming and knowledge to work in quantitative research or investment analytics. 
      I want to design systems that make smarter financial decisions through machine learning and AI.
      At the same time, I also hope to continue exploring the world, skiing in new places, and capturing my travel experiences through photography.
