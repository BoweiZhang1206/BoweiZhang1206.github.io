    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Bowei Zhang, a student at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Business Major. 
      I’m very interested in data analysis and financial technology. 
      In my free time, I enjoy exploring quantitative trading, data visualization, and the applications of artificial intelligence in the investment field. 
      When it comes to learning, I prefer to deepen my understanding through hands-on projects. 
      For example, I’ve built my own stock backtesting system and worked on small projects analyzing social media data.
      During my freetime, I like skiing and travelling. My dream is going to more places to ski, such as Switzerland and Canada.
      I've already been to 10+ countries and 30+ cities which I feel lucky and I really enjor the trip. Especially the food in different places bring me some magical feeling.
      I love going to the coastal city, i enjoy sea and beach, I sit near the sea for all day.
      Also I like fishing, this is a sport that can let me feel relax and be peaceful. And when I "fight" with the fish, its really hard but enjoyable.
      At home, I got two cats, one garflied and one british longhair, they have been with me about more than five years, I luv them very much!
      BTW, I am really good at cooking.
      That's all about me, thank you!
